  * Bullet list: Use (*) before text

  * Dashes: Use (-) before text and for subpoints put two spaces before (-) or (*)

6) Heading:

  * For code: Add 4 spaces or 3 backticks for multiple line code or 1 backtick for single line code.
```
print('SnehaArtz')
```
  * To add Syntax highlighting add the language

```
9) Tag: tag someone with @sneha in comments
10) Task lists: Can be used in pull/issue requests.
- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
11) Tables: You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

12) Strikethrough: Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
13) Emoji: :smile: :rofl: just put them inside colons.
